I made all these Java programs in Termux using Ubuntu proot-distro. With Open Java Development Kit 11.
Credit me if you ever use my work.
If you can not run the jar files, then: Install OpenJDK 11.
You can get OpenJDK 11 in the Eclipse Temurin site,
or if the link is dead. Go here: [https://mega.nz/folder/iYNylZ7a#HcfsP3vxM466JOLmXZQ2Fw]
